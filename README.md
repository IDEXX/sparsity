## Reading and writing SVMlight format

`read.svmlight()` and `write.svmlight()` read/write sparse matrices in SVMlight format.
You will find other functions for this on the internet, but the ones I found were either slow or handled only dense (=normal) matrices.

## Installation

devtools:::install_github("Laurae2/sparsity")
